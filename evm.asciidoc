== Ethereum Virtual Machine

=== What is it?

==== Compare to

* Virtual Machine (Virtualbox, QEMU, cloud computing)

* Java VM

Virtual Machine technologies such as Virtualbox and QEMU/KVM differ from the EVM in that their purpose is to provide hypervisor functionality, or a software abstraction that handles system calls, task scheduling, and resource management between a guest OS and the underlying host OS and hardware.

==== EVM Machine Language (Bytecode)

The EVM Maching Language is divided into specific instruction set groups, such as arithmetic oprations, logical and comparison operations, control flow, system calls, stack operations, and memory operations. In addition to the typical bytecode operations, the EVM must also manage account information (i.e. address and balance), current gas price, and block information.
