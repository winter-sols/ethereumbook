He honed his speaking skills in front of audiences ranging in size from five executives in a boardroom to thousands of people at large conferences. With more than 400 speaking engagements under his belt he is considered a world-class and charismatic public speaker and teacher. In 2014, he was appointed as a teaching fellow with the University of Nicosia, the first university in the world to offer a masters degree in digital currency.

<p><strong>Gavin Wood</strong> is a life-long devotee to the intersection of game theory, society and technology. Having become an enthusiast of computers and programming at the age of 9, he went on to become a "bedroom coder", collaborating with friends from school to produce some well-received computer games in the Commodore Amiga era. He studied at the Royal Grammer School in Lancaster, UK and later spent seven years at the University of York where he completed a PhD in Computer Science, specialising in neural networks and signal-analysis for music visualisation. During this time he became a prolific open-source coder, leading and contributing to various projects including parts of KDE.</p>

<p>After leaving university he worked for a childhood hero in the games industry to create a cross-platform high-performance audio engine before moving on to occasional freelance work for Microsoft Research in the domain of embedded C++ domain-specific languages. In his time away from professional work he was a schoolteacher, helping with maths, art and english, he designed and published (together with Aeron Buchanan) a board game "Milton Keynes" and he did personal research into voting systems and advanced programming tools, culminating in creating the first C++ language workbench. Two startups later, a mutual friend made the introduction to Vitalik Buterin (the author of the first Ethereum whitepaper) in late 2013, and a month or so later Gavin, Vitalik and the other six "co-founders" founded Ethereum.</p>

<p>Gavin coded the first functional implementation of Ethereum "PoC-1" having implemented it in a few weeks and served as CTO and effective platform architect, building upon Vitalik's original idea for a version of Bitcoin that had storage and flexible scripting. He coined the terms "EVM", "PoA" and "Web 3.0" with the latter being his nebulous platform for the decentralised web platform. He devised the Solidity contract language and wrote the Yellow Paper, the first formal specification of any blockchain protocol and one of the key ways Ethereum distinguishes itself from other blockchains.</p>

<p>In the months after Ethereum launched, Gavin left his position as CTO of the Ethereum Foundation with several others and founded Parity Technologies, a venture-backed firm to continue building out the original Ethereum vision. He serves as the founder and president of the Web 3 Foundation and is currently focussed on Polkadot, a next-generation blockchain to help provide the platform for future innovations in the space.</p>
