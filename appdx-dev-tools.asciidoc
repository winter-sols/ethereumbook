== Development Tools, Frameworks and Libraries

=== Frameworks

Frameworks can be used to ease Ethereum smart contracts development. By doing everything yourself you get a better understanding of how everything fits together, but it's a lot of tedious, repetitive work. The frameworks listed below can automate certain tasks and make development a breeze.

[[truffle]]
==== Truffle

[[installing_truffle]]
===== Installing the truffle framework

The truffle framework comprises several Node.js packages. Before we install +truffle+, we need to have an up-to-date and working installation of Node.js and the Node Package Manager (+npm+).

The recommended way to install Node.js and +npm+ is to use the Node Version Manager (NVM), +nvm+. Once we install +nvm+, it will handle all the dependencies and updates for us. We'll follow the instructions found at http://nvm.sh

Once +nvm+ is installed on your operating system, installing Node.js is simple. We use the +--lts+ flag to tell nvm that we want the most recent "Long Term Support (LTS)" version of Node.js:

----
$ nvm install --lts
----

Confirm you have +node+ and +npm+ installed:

----
$ node -v
v8.9.4
$ npm -v
5.6.0
----

Create a hidden file +.nvmrc+ that contains the Node.js version supported by your DApp so developers just need to run `nvm install` in the root of the project directory and it will automatically install and switch to using that version.

----
$ node -v > .nvmrc
$ nvm install
----

Looking good. Now to install truffle:

----
$ npm -g install truffle

+ truffle@4.0.6
installed 1 package in 37.508s
----

[[truffle_box]]
===== Integrating a pre-built Truffle project (Truffle Box)

If we want to use or create a DApp that builds upon a pre-built boilerplate, then at the Truffle Boxes link we can choose an existing Truffle project, and then run the following to download and extract it:

----
$ truffle unbox <BOX_NAME>
----

[[truffle_project_directory]]
===== Creating a truffle project directory

For each project where we will use truffle, we create a project directory and initialize truffle within that directory. Truffle will create the necessary directory structure inside our project directory. Customarily, we give the project directory a name that describes our project. For this example, we will use truffle to deploy our faucet contract from <<simple_contract_example>>, and therefore we will name the project folder +Faucet+.

----
$ mkdir Faucet
$ cd Faucet
Faucet $
----

Once inside the +Faucet+ directory, we initialize truffle:

----
Faucet $ truffle init
----

Truffle creates a directory structure and some default files:

----
Faucet
+---- contracts
|   `---- Migrations.sol
+---- migrations
|   `---- 1_initial_migration.js
+---- test
+---- truffle-config.js
`---- truffle.js
----

We will also use a number of JavaScript (Node.js) support packages, in addition to truffle itself. We can install these with npm. We initialize the npm directory structure and accept the defaults suggested by npm:

----
$ npm init

package name: (faucet)
version: (1.0.0)
description:
entry point: (truffle-config.js)
test command:
git repository:
keywords:
author:
license: (ISC)
About to write to Faucet/package.json:

{
  "name": "faucet",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "truffle-config.js",
  "directories": {
    "test": "test"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC"
}


Is this ok? (yes)
----

Now, we can install the dependencies that we will use to make working with truffle easier:

----
$ npm install dotenv truffle-wallet-provider ethereumjs-wallet
----

You now have a +node_modules+ directory with several thousand files inside your Faucet directory.

Prior to deploying the DApp to a cloud production or continuous integration environment it is important to specify the +engines+ field so that your DApp is built with the correct Node.js version and its associated dependencies are installed.

Package.json +engines+ field configuration: https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#engines

===== Configuring truffle

Truffle creates some empty configuration files, +truffle.js+ and +truffle-config.js+. On Windows systems the +truffle.js+ name may cause a conflict when you try to run the command +truffle+ and Windows attempts to run +truffle.js+ instead. To avoid this, we will delete +truffle.js+ and use +truffle-config.js+, in support of Windows users who, honestly, suffer enough already.

----
$ rm truffle.js
----

Now we edit +truffle-config.js+ and replace the contents with:

////

TODO The caption does not appear in the PDF. I think it should, it's useful!

////

[[truffle_config]]
.truffle-config.js - a truffle configuration to get us started
[source,javascript,linenums]
----
module.exports = {
	networks: {
		localnode: { // Whatever network our local node connects to
			network_id: "*", // Match any network id
			host: "localhost",
			port: 8545,
		}
	}
};
----

The configuration above is a good starting point. It sets up one default Ethereum network (named +localnode+), which assumes you are running an Ethereum client (such as parity), either as a full node, or as a light client. This configuration will instruct truffle to communicate with the local node over RPC, on port 8545. Truffle will use whatever Ethereum network the local node is connected to, such as the Ethereum main network, or a test network like Ropsten. The local node will also be providing the wallet functionality.

In following sections, we will configure additional networks for truffle to use, such as the +ganache+ local test blockchain, and Infura, a hosted network provider. As we add more networks, the configuration file will get more complex, but it will also give us more options for our testing and development workflow.

===== Using truffle to deploy a contract

We now have a basic working directory for our +Faucet+ project, and we have truffle and its dependencies configured. Contracts go in the +contracts+ subdirectory of our project. The directory already contains a "helper" contract, +Migrations.sol+, which manages contract upgrades for us. We'll examine the use of +Migrations.sol+ in a later section.

Let's copy the +Faucet.sol+ contract (from <<solidity_faucet_example>>) into the +contracts+ subdirectory, so that the project directory looks like this:

----
Faucet
+---- contracts
|   +---- Faucet.sol
|   `---- Migrations.sol
...
----

We can now ask truffle to compile the contract for us:

----
$ truffle compile
Compiling ./contracts/Faucet.sol...
Compiling ./contracts/Migrations.sol...
Writing artifacts to ./build/contracts
----

===== Truffle migrations - understanding deployment scripts

Truffle offers a deployment system called a _migration_. If you have worked in other frameworks, you may have seen something similar: Ruby on Rails, Python Django and many other languages and frameworks have a +migrate+ command.

In all those frameworks, the purpose of a migration is to handle changes in the data schema between different versions of the software. The purpose of migrations in Ethereum is slightly different. Because Ethereum contracts are immutable and cost gas to deploy, truffle offers a migration mechanism to keep track of which contracts (and which versions) have already been deployed. In a complex project with dozens of contracts and complex dependencies, you would not want to have to pay to redeploy contracts that haven't changed. You would also not want to manually track which versions of which contracts have been deployed already. The truffle migration mechanism does all that by deploying the smart contract +Migrations.sol+, which then keeps track of all other contract deployments.

We have only one contract, +Faucet.sol+, which means that the migration system is overkill, to say the least. Unfortunately, we have to use it. But, by learning how to use it for one contract, we can start practicing some good habits for our development workflow. The effort will pay off as things get more complicated.

Truffle's +migrations+ directory is where the migration scripts are found. Right now, there's only one script +1_initial_migration.js+, which deploys the +Migrations.sol+ contract itself:

[[1_initial_migration]]
[source,javascript,linenums]
----
include::code/truffle/Faucet/migrations/1_initial_migration.js[]
----

We need a second migration script, to deploy +Faucet.sol+. Let's call it +2_deploy_contracts.js+. It is very simple, just like +1_initial_migration.js+, with only a few small changes. In fact, you can copy the contents of +1_initial_migration.js+ and simply replace all instances of +Migrations+ with +Faucet+:

[source,javascript,linenums]
----
include::code/truffle/Faucet/migrations/2_deploy_contracts.js[]
----

The script initializes a variable +Faucet+, identifying the +Faucet.sol+ Solidity source code as the artifact that defines +Faucet+. Then, it calls the deploy function to deploy this contract.

We're all set. Let's use +truffle migrate+ to deploy the contract. We have to specify on which network to deploy the contract, using the +--network+ argument. We only have one network specified in the configuration file, which we named +localnode+. Make sure your local Ethereum client is running and then type:

----
Faucet $ truffle migrate --network localnode
----

Because we are using a local node to connect to the Ethereum network and manage our wallet, we have to authorize the transaction that truffle creates. I'm running +parity+ connected to the Ropsten test blockchain, so during the truffle migration I will see a pop-up on parity's web console:

[[parity_deployment_confirmation]]
.Parity asking for confirmation to deploy Faucet
image::images/parity_deployment_confirmation.png["Parity asking for confirmation to deploy Faucet"]

You will see four transactions, total. One to deploy +Migrations+, one to update the deployments counter to +1+, one to deploy +Faucet+ and one to update the deployments counter to +2+.

Truffle will show the migrations completing, show each of the transactions and show the contract addresses:

----
$ truffle migrate --network localnode
Using network 'localnode'.

===== Using the truffle console

Truffle offers a JavaScript console that we can use to interact with the Ethereum network (via the local node), interact with deployed contracts, and interact with the wallet provider. In our current configuration (+localnode+), the node and wallet provider is our local parity client.

Let's start the truffle console and try some commands:

----
$ truffle console --network localnode
truffle(localnode)>
----

Truffle presents a prompt, showing the selected network configuration (+localnode+). It's important to remember and be aware of which network we are using. You wouldn't want to accidentally deploy a test contract or make a transaction on the Ethereum main network. That could be an expensive mistake!

The truffle console offers an auto-complete function that makes it easy for us to explore the environment. If we press +Tab+ after a partially-completed command, truffle will complete the command for us. Pressing +Tab+ twice will show all possible completions if more than one command matches our input. In fact, if we press +Tab+ twice on an empty prompt, truffle lists all commands:

----
truffle(localnode)>
Array Boolean Date Error EvalError Function Infinity JSON Math NaN Number Object RangeError ReferenceError RegExp String SyntaxError TypeError URIError decodeURI decodeURIComponent encodeURI encodeURIComponent eval isFinite isNaN parseFloat parseInt undefined

__defineGetter__ __defineSetter__ __lookupGetter__ __lookupSetter__ __proto__ constructor hasOwnProperty isPrototypeOf propertyIsEnumerable toLocaleString toString valueOf
----

The vast majority of the wallet and node related functions are provided by the +web3+ object, which is an instance of the web3.js library. The +web3+ object abstracts the RPC interface to our parity node. You will also notice two objects with familiar names: +Migrations+ and +Faucet+. Those represent the contracts we just deployed. We will use the truffle console to interact with a contract. First, let's check our wallet via the +web3+ object:

----
truffle(localnode)> web3.eth.accounts
[ '0x9e713963a92c02317a681b9bb3065a8249de124f',
  '0xdb5dc1a13e3a55cf3b4587cd8d1e5fdeb6738145' ]
----

Our parity client has two wallets, with some test ether on Ropsten. The +web3.eth.accounts+ attribute contains a list of all the accounts. We can check the balance of the first account, using the +getBalance+ function:

----
truffle(localnode)> web3.eth.getBalance(web3.eth.accounts[0]).toNumber()
191198572800000000
truffle(localnode)>
----

The web3.js is a large JavaScript library that offers a comprehensive interface to the Ethereum system, via a provider such as a local client. We will examine web3.js in more detail in <<web3js>>. Now let's try to interact with our contracts:

----
truffle(localnode)> Faucet.address
'0xd01cd8e7bd29e4bff8c1693f59eee46137a9f300'
truffle(localnode)> web3.eth.getBalance(Faucet.address).toNumber()
0
truffle(localnode)>
----

Next, we'll use +sendTransaction+ to send some test ether to fund the +Faucet+. Note the use of +web3.toWei+ to convert ether units for us. Typing eighteen zeros without making a mistake is both difficult and dangerous, so it's always better to use a unit converter for values. Here's how we send the transaction:

----
truffle(localnode)> web3.eth.sendTransaction({from:web3.eth.accounts[0], to:Faucet.address, value:web3.toWei(0.5, 'ether')});
'0xf134c75b985dc0e0c27c2f0412251e0860eb530a5055e660f21e7483ab336808'
----

Switch to the web console on +parity+, where you will see a pop-up asking you to confirm this transaction. Wait a minute and once the transaction is mined, you will be able to see the balance of our +Faucet+ contract:

----
truffle(localnode)> web3.eth.getBalance(Faucet.address).toNumber()
500000000000000000
----

Let's call the +withdraw+ function now, to withdraw some test ether from the Faucet:

----
truffle(localnode)> Faucet.deployed().then(instance => {instance.withdraw(web3.toWei(0.1, 'ether'))}).then(console.log)
----

Again, you will need to approve the transaction in the parity web console. The balance of the +Faucet+ has decreased, and our test wallet has received +0.1+ ether:

----
truffle(localnode)> web3.eth.getBalance(Faucet.address).toNumber()
400000000000000000
----


----
truffle(localnode)> Faucet.deployed().then(instance => {instance.withdraw(web3.toWei(1, 'ether'))})
----

----
StatusError: Transaction: 0xe147ae9e3610334ada8d863c9028c12bd0501be2d0cfd05865c18612b92d3f9c exited with an error (status 0).

==== OpenZeppelin

https://openzeppelin.org/[OpenZeppelin] is an open framework of reusable and secure smart contracts in the Solidity language.

It is community-driven, led by the https://zeppelin.solutions/[Zeppelin] team, with over a hundred external contributors. The main focus of the framework is security, achieved by applying industry-standard contract security patterns and best practices, taking advantage of all the experience the Zeppelin devs have gained from https://blog.zeppelin.solutions/tagged/security[auditing] a huge number of contracts, and through constant testing and auditing from the community that uses the framework as a base for their real-world applications.

The OpenZeppelin framework is the most widely used solution for Ethereum smart contracts. This is due to the community discussing every proposed solution and learning from the implementation and integration of these solutions, which drives a feedback loop that improves the existing contracts and finds new ways to combine them in a clear and secure architecture. It has resulted in the constant addition of new reusable contracts to solve increasingly complex challenges or explore exciting new possibilities on top of the Ethereum blockchain. As mentioned before, the framework currently has an ample library of contracts including implementations of `ERC20` and `ERC721` tokens, many flavors of crowdsale models, and simple behaviors commonly found in contracts such as `Ownable`, `Pausable` or `LimitBalance`. The contracts in this repository in some cases function as _de facto_ standard implementations.

The framework has an MIT license, and all the contracts have been designed with a modular approach to guarantee ease of reuse and extension. These are clean and basic building blocks, ready to be used on your next Ethereum project. Let's set up the framework and build a simple crowdsale using the OpenZeppelin contracts, as an example of how easy it is to use. This example also stresses the importance of reusing secure components instead of writing them by yourself, and gives a small sample of the ideas that the Ethereum platform and its community are making possible.

First, we will need to install the +openzeppelin-solidity+ library into our workspace. The latest release as of the time of this writing is `v1.9.0`, so we will use that one.

----
mkdir sample-crowdsale
cd sample-crowdsale
npm install openzeppelin-solidity@1.9.0
mkdir contracts
----

For the crowdsale we will need to define a token to give investors in exchange for ether. At the time of writing, OpenZeppelin includes multiple basic token contracts that follow the ERC20, ERC721 and ERC827 standards, with different characteristics for emission, limits, vesting, lifecycle, etc.

Let's make an ERC20 token that's mintable, meaning that the initial supply starts at 0 and new tokens can be created by the token owner (in our case, the crowdsale contract) and assigned to the investors. In order to do this, create a `contracts/SampleToken.sol` file with the following contents:

----
include::code/OpenZeppelin/contracts/SampleToken.sol[]
----

OpenZeppelin already provides a MintableToken contract that we can use as a base for our token, so we only define the details that are specific to our case. Next, let's make the crowdsale contract. Just like with tokens, OpenZeppelin already provides a wide variety of crowdsale flavors. Currently, you will find contracts for various scenarios involving distribution, emission, price, and validation. So, let’s say that you want to set a goal for your crowdsale and if it’s not met by the time the sale finishes, you want to refund all your investors. For that, you can use the https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/blob/v1.9.0/contracts/crowdsale/distribution/RefundableCrowdsale.sol[RefundableCrowdsale] contract. Maybe you want to define a crowdsale with an increasing price to incentivize early buyers; there is the https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/blob/v1.9.0/contracts/crowdsale/price/IncreasingPriceCrowdsale.sol[IncreasingPriceCrowdsale] contract just for that. Or maybe end the crowdsale when a specified amount of ether has been received by the contract (https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/blob/v1.9.0/contracts/crowdsale/validation/CappedCrowdsale.sol[CappedCrowdsale]), or set a finishing time with the https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/blob/v1.9.0/contracts/crowdsale/validation/TimedCrowdsale.sol[TimedCrowdsale] contract, or a whitelist of buyers with the https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/blob/v1.9.0/contracts/crowdsale/validation/WhitelistedCrowdsale.sol[WhitelistedCrowdsale] contract.

As we said before, the OpenZeppelin contracts are basic building blocks. These crowdsale contracts have been designed to be combined; just read the source code of the base https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/blob/v1.9.0/contracts/crowdsale/Crowdsale.sol[Crowdsale] contract for directions on how to extend it. For the crowdsale of our token, we need to mint tokens when ether is received by the crowdsale contract, so let's use https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/blob/v1.9.0/contracts/crowdsale/emission/MintedCrowdsale.sol[MintedCrowdsale] as a base. And to make it more interesting, let's make it also a https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/blob/v1.9.0/contracts/crowdsale/distribution/PostDeliveryCrowdsale.sol[PostDeliveryCrowdsale] so the tokens can only be withdrawn after the crowdsale ends. Write the following into `contracts/SampleCrowdsale.sol`:

----
include::code/OpenZeppelin/contracts/SampleCrowdsale.sol[]
----

Again, we barely had to write any code, just reuse the battle-tested code that the OpenZeppelin community made available. However, it is important to note that this case is different than that of our `SampleToken` contract. If you go to the https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/tree/v1.9.0/test/crowdsale[Crowdsale automated tests] you will see that they are tested in isolation. When you integrate different units of code into a bigger component, it's not enough to test all the units separately, because the interactions between them might cause behaviors that you didn't expect. In particular, you will see that here we introduced multiple inheritance, which can surprise the developer if they don't understand the details of Solidity. Our `SampleCrowdsale` is simple, and it will work just as we expect because the framework was designed to make cases like these straightforward; but do not relax your vigilance because of the simplicity that this framework introduces. Every time you integrate parts of the OpenZeppelin framework to build a more complex solution, you must fully test every aspect of your solution to ensure that all the interactions of the units work as you intend.

Finally, when we are happy with our solution and have tested it thoroughly, we need to deploy it. OpenZeppelin integrates well with Truffle, so we can just write a migrations file as explained in the Truffle section above. Write the following in +migrations/2_deploy_contracts.js+:

----
include::code/OpenZeppelin/migrations/2_deploy_contracts.js[]
----

This was just a quick overview of a few of the contracts that are part of the OpenZeppelin framework. There are many more, and the community is always proposing ideas for new ones, implementing new strategies to make them safer, simpler and clearer, and trying to find holes early to prevent vulnerabilities in mainnet contracts. You are welcome to join the community to learn and contribute.

==== zeppelin_os
https://github.com/zeppelinos[zeppelin_os] is an open source, distributed platform of tools and services on top of the EVM
to develop and manage smart contract applications securely.

Unlike OpenZeppelin's code, which needs to be re-deployed with each application every time, zeppelin_os's code lives on-chain. Applications that need a given functionality, say, an ERC20 token, not only do not have to re-design and re-audit its implementation (something that OpenZeppelin solved) but do not even need to deploy it. With zeppelin_os, an application interacts with the token's on-chain implementation directly, in much the same way as a desktop application interacts with the components of its underlying OS.

Applications that make use of OpenZeppelin avoid having to reinvent the wheel, by reusing the library's curated and peer reviewed contracts. However, each time an application uses an ERC20 token implementation, the same ERC20 bytecode is deployed into the blockchain, over and over again. Such bytecode exists duplicated in the network countless times. Now, applications that make use of zeppelin_os avoid this unnecessary duplication. Instead of deploying their own ERC20 implementation, they link to a contract that defines the latest ERC20 implementation accepted by the community. This single, central implementation is deployed in the blockchain only once, much like Solidity's libraries, but are considerably more sophisticated.

Unlike Solidity's libraries, the implementations offered by zeppelin_os can be treated like regular contracts, i.e. they have storage. Also, they are upgradeable. If a vulnerability is ever found in one of the OS's official implementations, it can simply be swapped with an upgraded one. In the case of the ERC20 token, an upgrade to its implementation would instantly ripple to all the applications that use it. The OS not only provides upgradeability for all of its implementations, but also for the user's own contracts, and even for its own codebase! Developers decide when and how an application should implement an upgrade, and even which "flavor" of an implementation to adhere to.

At the core of zeppelin_os sits a very clever contract known as a "proxy". A proxy is a contract that is capable of wrapping any other contract, exposing its interface without having to manually implement setters and getters for it, and can upgrade it without losing state. In Solidity terms, it can be seen as a normal contract whose business logic is contained within a library, which can be swapped for a new library at any time without losing its state. The way in which the proxy links to its implementation is completely automated and encapsulated for the developer. Practically any contract can be made upgradeable with little to no change in its code. More about zeppelin_os's proxy mechanism can be found in zeppelin_os's blog: https://blog.zeppelinos.org/[upgradeability-using-unstructured-storage], and an example of how to use it can be found here: https://github.com/zeppelinos/zos-lib/tree/master/examples/single.

The OS wraps its implementations in packages or "releases" that can be vouched for using ZepTokens. ZepTokens can be staked against a release, signaling that it is the community's accepted implementation. Anyone can submit new releases that can be scrutinized by the community and eventually accepted as official. As a reward, developers of a release receive tokens each time it is vouched for. As a DApp developer, vouching provides a measurable way to determine how much is staked for a given release, and hence how much it can be trusted.

Developing applications using zeppelin_os is similar to developing JavaScript applications using NPM. An AppManager handles an application package for each version of the application. A package is simply a directory of contracts, each of which can have one or more upgradeable proxies. The AppManager not only provides proxies for application-specific contracts, but also does so for zeppelin_os implementations, in the form of a standard library. To see a full example of this, please visit: https://github.com/zeppelinos/zos-lib/tree/master/[examples/complex].
//// TODO: the example provided above is still a WIP - link to a tutorial once it's finished

Although currently in development, zeppelin_os aims to provide a wide set of additional features, such as developer tools, a scheduler that automates background operations within contracts, development bounties, a marketplace that facilitates communication and exchange of value between applications, and much more. All of this is described in zeppelin_os's https://zeppelinos.org/zeppelin_os_[whitepaper].pdf.

[[testing_frameworks]]
=== Testing smart contracts

There are several commonly-used test frameworks for smart contract development, summarized in <<testing_frameworks_table>>, below.

[[testing_frameworks_table]]
.Smart Contract Test Frameworks
|=======
|Framework | Test Language(s)    | Testing Framework | Chain Emulator       | Website
|Truffle   | JavaScript/Solidity | Mocha             | TestRPC/Ganache      | truffleframework.com
|Embark    | JavaScript          | Mocha             | TestRPC/Ganache      | embark.readthedocs.io
|DApp      | Solidity            | ds-test (custom)  | Ethrun (Parity)      | dapp.readthedocs.io
|Populus   | Python              | Pytes             | Python chain emulator| populus.readthedocs.io
|=======


Truffle Test:: Part of the Truffle framework, Truffle allows for unit tests to be written in JavaScript (Mocha based) or Solidity. These tests are run against Ganache.

Embark Framework Testing:: Embark integrates with Mocha to run unit tests written in JavaScript. The tests are in turn run against contracts deployed on TestRPC/Ganache. The Embark Framework automatically deploys smart contracts, and will automatically redeploy the contracts when they are changed. It also keeps track of deployed contracts and deploys contracts only when truly needed. Embark includes a testing library to rapidly run and test your contracts in an EVM, with functions like +assert.equal()+. The command +embark test+ will run any test files under directory +test+.

DApp:: DApp uses native Solidity code (a library called ds-test) and a Parity-built Rust library called Ethrun to execute Ethereum bytecode and then assert correctness. The ds-test library provides assertion functions for validating correctness and events for logging data in the console.

Assertions functions include:

----
assert(bool condition)
assertEq(address a, address b)
assertEq(bytes32 a, bytes32 b)
assertEq(int a, int b)
assertEq(uint a, uint b)
assertEq0(bytes a, bytes b)
expectEventsExact(address target)
----

Logging commands will log information to the console, making them useful for debugging:

----
logs(bytes)
log_bytes32(bytes32)
log_named_bytes32(bytes32 key, bytes32 val)
log_named_address(bytes32 key, address val)
log_named_int(bytes32 key, int val)
log_named_uint(bytes32 key, uint val)
log_named_decimal_int(bytes32 key, int val, uint decimals)
log_named_decimal_uint(bytes32 key, uint val, uint decimals)
----

Populus:: Populus uses Python and its own chain emulator to run contracts written in Solidity. Unit tests are written in Python with the +pytest+ library. Populus supports writing contracts specifically for testing. These contract filenames should match the glob pattern +Test*.sol+ and be located anywhere under the project tests directory +tests+.


[[on_blockchain_testing_sec]]
==== On-Blockchain Testing

Although most testing shouldn't occur on deployed contracts, a contract's behavior can be checked via Ethereum clients.  The following commands can be used to assess a smart contract's state. These commands should be typed at the '+geth+' terminal, although any web3 console will also support these commands.

....
eth.getTransactionReceipt(txhash);
....
Gets the address of a contract at `+txhash+`.
....
eth.getCode(contractaddress)
....
Gets the code of a contract deployed at `+contractaddress+`. This can be used to verify proper deployment.
....
eth.getPastLogs(options)
....
Gets the full logs of the contract located at the address specified in +options+. This is helpful for viewing the history of a contract's calls.
....
eth.getStorageAt(address, position)
....
Gets the storage located at +address+ with an offset of +position+.

[[ganache]]
==== Ganache: A local test blockchain

Ganache is a local test blockchain that you can use to deploy contracts, develop your applications, and run tests. It is available as a desktop application (with a graphical user interface) for Windows, Mac, and Linux. It is also available as a command-line utility called +ganache-cli+. For more details and installation instructions for the Ganache desktop application, see:

https://truffleframework.com/ganache

The +ganache-cli+ code can be found here:

https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache-cli/

To install the command line +ganache-cli+, use +npm+:

----
$ npm install -g ganache-cli
----

We can use ganache-cli to start a local blockchain for testing.

----
$ ganache-cli \
  --networkId=3 \
  --port="8545" \
  --verbose \
  --gasLimit=8000000 \
  --gasPrice=4000000000;
----


* [ ] Check the `--networkId` and `--port` flag values match your configuration in truffle.js
* [ ] Check the `--gasLimit` flag value matches the latest mainnet Gas Limit (i.e. 8000000 gas) shown at https://ethstats.net to avoid encountering `out of gas` exceptions unnecessarily. Note that a `--gasPrice` of 4000000000 represents a Gas Price of 4 gwei.
* [ ] Optionally enter a `--mnemonic` flag value to restore a previous HD wallet and associated addresses
