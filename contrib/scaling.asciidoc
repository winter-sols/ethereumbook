# Scaling Ethereum
The most notable problem public blockchains face is scaling.
As for Ethereum it can support around 15 state updates (aka. transactions) per second.
Compared to 1000 transactions per second PayPal support, or the millions state updates Twitter support we can clearly see the problem, Ethereum can not support a massive adoption of users.
The infamous Crypto Kitties flue of December 2017 showed us exactly what a small pick in the usage of Ethereum can do to the network, transactions were taking hours to days and the fees were about 40 Gwei - more than 10 times higher than the typical fee.
The reason for this scalability issue can be explained using what's called "The Blockchain Trillema". This is a trillema where (without decent solution) a blockchain can support only 2 edges and needs to compromise on the third one. 
The three edges are: Scalability, Decentralization and Security.
We can look what each combination of 2 of the 3 will may look like.
Scalability and Security - This is a private blockchain. Since the consensus needs to be achieved only between a small cluster of trusted nodes (or maybe only one) there is no need for many security features public blockchains need and the communication between a few nodes is much faster than between a big decentralized network.
Scalability and Decentralization - A great example for that is when using public blockchain like Bitcoin or Ethereum neither 0 block confirmations. This may allow instant transactions with no fees but it is extremely insecure to the point it is just not useful for almost no case.
Decentralization and Security - this is where most public blockchains including Bitcoin and Ethereum are at. They are decentralized and secure but as said before, they are very slow.

The problem with this Trillema is you can't completely win it. You just can't support very high TPS, have huge open network of nodes and be secure enough.
With that in mind we can start explore the different approaches of scaling the public blockchain without decreasing decentralization nor security.
It is important to understand, since it is not possible to completely satisfy all the 3 at the same time most solutions tries to get to some point in the middle, where they have decent security, decentralization and scalability.
