[[_anchor_operate_private_network]]
== Operating a private Ethereum network

Once the set-up for private network is completed, the network has the following nodes peering with each other:

* Ethereum boot node for other machines to look up for peering.
* Ethereum mining node that does mining.
* Ethereum RPC node that exposes RPC port for programmatic access.
* Ethereum stand alone node that does not mine or expose API.

To learn more about setting up the network, see link:aws-network-setup.asciidoc[AWS network set-up].

Now, the network is ready for deployment of smart contracts. The steps to be followed for deployment of contracts are as follows:

. Account set-up <<_anchor_account_set_up>>
. Deploy contract <<_anchor_deploy_contract>>
. Interacting with the contract <<_anchor_interacting_with_the_contract>>
