= Beginning
// Kept short since this history is covered elsewhere

Ethereum was first described by Vitalik Buterin in the _Ethereum White Paper_ <<ethereumwp>> at the end of 2013 and announced in Januray 2014 at The North American Bitcoin Conference in Miami, Florida.

More history on Ethereum can be found in the <<../what-is.asciidoc#ethereum_birth, Ethereum Birth>> section of <<what-is.asciidoc>>.

= Fork (Split of Ethereum and ETC)
// April-July 2016; events leading up to the fork through the fork
// This is just the initial timeline recorded for ease. Will be worked into a story structure later.

Terms:
- DAO Attacker - An unknown person/entity that started attacking The DAO on June 17. Eventually taking ~3 million total Ether.
- Robinhood Group (RHG) - Lead by Jordi Baylina (jbaylina), this group secured the other ~7.2 million Ether.
- DAO Attack - The incident that lead to DAO funds being drained through the re-entrancy bug
- DAO Fork - The hard fork to reverse the effects of the DAO Attack

- April 5th: Slock.It creates The DAO following a security audit by Dejavu Security (https://blog.slock.it/deja-vu-dao-smart-contracts-audit-results-d26bc088e32e)
- April 30th: The DAO crowdsale launches (https://blog.slock.it/the-dao-creation-is-now-live-2270fd23affc)
- May 27: The DAO crowdsale ends
- June 9: A potential recursive call bug is discovered and believed to affect many Solidity contracts that track user's balances (http://vessenes.com/more-ethereum-attacks-race-to-empty-is-the-real-deal/)
- June 12: Stephen Tual declares that DAO funds are not at risk (https://blog.slock.it/no-dao-funds-at-risk-following-the-ethereum-smart-contract-recursive-call-bug-discovery-29f482d348b)
- June 17: The DAO is exploited and a variant of the recursive call bug (termed the "re-entry bug") is used to start draining the funds. (http://hackingdistributed.com/2016/06/18/analysis-of-the-dao-exploit/)
- June 21: The RHG is announces it has secured ~70% of the Ether stored within The DAO. The Attacker holds the other 30%. (https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/4p7mhc/update_on_the_white_hat_attack/)
- June 24 2016: A soft fork vote is announced via opt-in signaling through Geth and Parity clients. This is designed to temporarily withhold funds until the community can better decide on what to do. (https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/06/24/dao-wars-youre-voice-soft-fork-dilemma/)
- June 28: A vulnerability is discovered in the soft fork and it's abandoned.(https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/06/28/security-alert-dos-vulnerability-in-the-soft-fork/)
- June 28 to July 15: Users debate on whether or not to hard fork. Most of the debate occurs on the /r/ethereum subreddit.
- July 15: The DAO Hard Fork is proposed to reverse The DAO Attack. (https://blog.slock.it/hard-fork-specification-24b889e70703)
- July 15: A vote is held on carbonvote to decide if the DAO Fork is opt-in (don't fork by default) or opt-out (fork by default) (https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/07/15/to-fork-or-not-to-fork/).
- July 15 - 20: 5.5% of the total Ether supply votes, ~80% of the votes (~4.5% of the total supply) are pro the opt-out hard fork. One quarter of the pro-DAO Fork vote comes from a single address.(https://elaineou.com/2016/07/18/stick-a-fork-in-ethereum/)
- July 20: The hard fork occurs at block 1,920,000. (https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/07/20/hard-fork-completed/ & https://etherscan.io/block/1920000)
- July 20: Those against the DAO Fork continue running the old non-hard fork client software. This leads to issues with transactions being replayed on both chains. (https://gastracker.io/block/0x94365e3a8c0b35089c1d1195081fe7489b528a84b22199c916180db8b28ade7f)
- July 24: Poloniex lists the original Ethereum chain under the ticker symbol ETC; the first exchange to do so. (https://twitter.com/poloniex/status/757068619234803712)
- August 10: The RHG transfers 2.9 million of the recovered ETC to Poloniex in order to convert it to ETH under the advice of Bity SA. 14% of the total RHG holdings are converted from ETC to ETH and other cryptocurrencies.(https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/millions-of-dollars-worth-of-etc-may-soon-be-dumped-on-the-market-1472567361/) 
- August 30: Poloniex subsequently freezes these funds and they're eventually sent back to the RHG. RHG then sets up a refund contract on the ETC chain. (https://medium.com/@jackfru1t/the-robin-hood-group-and-etc-bdc6a0c111c3 & https://www.reddit.com/r/EthereumClassic/comments/4xauca/follow_up_statement_on_the_etc_salvaged_from/)
- Jan 13, 2017: The ETC network is updated to resolve transaction replay issues. Both chains are now functionally separate.(https://www.reddit.com/r/EthereumClassic/comments/5nt4qm/diehard_etc_protocol_upgrade_successful_nethash/)

// Maybe mention dev team formation but not sure how crucial they are to the actual split; early members did contribute code for the fork that created the split, as well as ecosystem/infrastructure (gastracker.io, nodes, etc.) 
// IOHK - December 11, 2016 (https://ethereumclassic.github.io/blog/2016-12-12-TeamGrothendieck/)
// ETCDEV - February 20, 2017 (Need a source)

= Differences Between Ethereum and Ethereum Classic

== The EVM
For the most part (as of April 2018) the two networks remain highly compatible. Contract code produced for one chain runs as expected on the other. Though there are minimal differences in EVM OPCODES (noted in EIPs 140, 145, and 214).

== Core Network Development
All blockchains ultimately have many users and contributors, by core network development we mean the code that runs the network. In this case, due to the expertise and knowledge required, the bulk of development is often done by discrete groups. As such the code that these groups produce, and that actually runs on the network, is very closely tied together.

*Ethereum:* Ethereum Foundation, and volunteers.

*Ethereum Classic:* ETCDEV, IOHK, and volunteers.

== Ideological differences
One of the biggest material differences between Ethereum and Ethereum Classic is ideology which manifests itself in two key ways: immutability and community structure.

=== Immutability
Within the context of blockchains, immutability refers to preservation of blockchain history.

*Ethereum:* Follows a philosophy that's colloquially termed "governance". This philosophy allows participants to vote, with varying degrees of representation, to change the blockchain in certain cases (such as The DAO attack).

*Ethereum Classic:* Stands firmly behind the philosophy that once data is on the blockchain it cannot be modified by others. This is a philosophy shared with Bitcoin, Litecoin, and other cryptocurrencies.

=== Community structure
While blockchains aim to be decentralized much of the world around them is centralized. Ethereum and Ethereum Classic approach this fact in different ways.

*Ethereum:* The Ethereum Foundation owns the /r/ethereum subreddit, ethereum.org website, forums, GitHub (ethereum), Twitter (@ethereum), Facebook, and Google+ account. 

*Ethereum Classic:* Owned by separate entities: /r/ethereumclassic subreddit, ethereumclassic.org, forums, GitHubs (ethereumproject, ethereumclassic, etcdevteam, iohk, ethereumcommonwealth), Twitter (@eth_classic), Telegrams, and Discord.

= Other networks (forks in both blockchain and codebase)
