[[_anchor_introduction_aws_setup]]
== Introduction

This section describes in detail the set-up of a private Ethereum network and deployment of *Mastering Ethereum Token (MET)* on Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud.

Broadly, the following steps are to be followed.

. Set up nodes for launch
. Configuring genesis for nodes 
. Peering
. Account set-up 
. Mining
. RPC end-point
. Contract deployment and execution

In the set-up of nodes for peering, two options for peer discovery exist. First, the nodes may look-up a boot node and second, the peers are added manually. The rest of the steps remain the same. 

[[_anchor_pre_requisites]]
== Pre-requisites

The following pre-requisites apply:

- An AWS account. If you do not have one, create here https://aws.amazon.com/account/
- General command line knowledge on Linux (ideally, Ubuntu) operating system.

[[_anchor_node_setup]]
=== Set up nodes for launch

The nodes to be launched for this set-up will be for the topology shown in figure below.

image::images/aws-topology-simple-bootnode.png["Simple topology of Ethereum nodes with bootnode"]

In the table below, the nodes in the topology are described. These nodes will be referred to by the name as mentioned in this table.

[[_table_aws_topology_nodes]]
.AWS Topology - Nodes 
|==================================================================================================================================
|Name |Type |Remarks
|Ethereum-Boot-Node |Boot node |Runs `bootnode` for other machines in network to discover peers.
|Ethereum-RPC-Node |RPC node |Has an RPC port open for RPC clients such as `web3.js` to connect to.
|Ethereum-Mining-Node |Mining node |Mines blocks and appends to Blockchain.
|Ethereum-Standalone-Node |Stand-alone node |Runs a basic `geth` node.
|==================================================================================================================================

[[_anchor_launch_instances]]
==== Launch instances
To choose the right instance for launching an Ethereum node, the following points can help.

* *Memory requirements*. For `geth`, this page on Metrics and Monitoring can help analyse the memory requirements of an instance running `geth`. https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Metrics-and-Monitoring
* *Storage requiremens*. For `Parity`, this blog post has some excellent information on storage growth for Ethereum. https://dev.to/5chdn/the-ethereum-blockchain-size-will-not-exceed-1tb-anytime-soon-58a
* *Network requirements*. Depending on the rate of submitting transactions, an instance with appropriate network bandwidth may be selected. This rate also has an implication on the size of blocks and therefore, storage requirements.
* *CPU requirements*. The computation power is required especially for nodes set-up for mining. And, mining depends on hash rate and that in turn depends on the **difficulty level** setting for a network. Note that, the difficulty level also impacts the rate at which blocks are mined and therefore, impacts the network requirements.

It should be clear that, the infra-structure requirements for a node are inter-dependent.

The rest of this chapter assumes that, the nodes are launched on a `t2.micro` instance of AWS. When launching a `t2.micro` instance for Ethereum, accept the defaults that the wizard provides; unless, specific needs apply. For example, let the instance be launched in the default, public Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) in the chosen region. However, when applying securtiy groups, the following port numbers are suggested to be opened. 

It is *recommended* that, the port be opened for only the IP address that accesses AWS. Later, more detailed access rules maybe applied.

[[_table_AWS_instance_security_group]]

|==================================================================================================================================
|Port number| Protocol type| Description
|30303 | UDP | Default node discovery port.
|30303 | TCP | Default node discovery port.
|8545 | TCP | Default RPC port.
|22 | TCP | Default `ssh` port.
|==================================================================================================================================

Refer this link for guidance on launching EC2 instances. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EC2_GetStarted.html

[[_anchor_install_ethereum_client]]
==== Install Ethereum client
Once the instance is launched and logged on to, the Ethereum client, `geth`, needs to be installed with the steps below.

[source,bash]
----
sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:ethereum/ethereum
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y ethereum
----

To check for a successful installation, simply run `geth` on a command line. By default, `geth` will try to connect to the main network and start displaying messages immediately as shown below. 

[source,bash]
----
geth

----

If messages are visible, then `geth` has started successfully. To stop `geth`, simply hit `Ctrl-C`.

When `geth` is run for main network, then by default it uses the folder `$HOM#/.geth`. To work with private nodes, a new directory needs to be created - preferably under `$HOME`. Multiple such directories maybe created when working with multiple private networks.

[source,bash]
----
mkdir eth-priv
----

A key point to remember when working with private networks is to *always* refer the directory name in `geth` commands, via `--datadir` flag.


[[_anchor_node_configuration]]
=== Configuring genesis for nodes

Create a JSON document, `genesis.json` in `eth-priv` folder for genesis block. This document should exist in the same format and values in all the machines of the network.

[[_code_genesis_json]]
.genesis.json
[source,json]
----
{
    "config": {
        "chainId": 15,
        "homesteadBlock": 0,
        "eip155Block": 0,
        "eip158Block": 0
    },
    "nonce": "0x0000000000000042",
    "mixhash": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
    "difficulty": "0x4000",
    "alloc": {},
    "coinbase": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
    "timestamp": "0x00",
    "parentHash": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
    "gasLimit": "0xffffffff"
}
----

NOTES:
The `genesis.json` shown above has the following settings for a simplified set-up.

* `chainId` set to `15` to differentiate itself as a private Ethereum network. Any other positive integer may be used for `chainId` value.
* `gasLimit` is set to maximum so that, any contract maybe run successfully.
* `difficulty` is set to low so that, mining time is least.

For more details on all settings, see here: [https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/q/2376/3137]

[[_anchor_node_init]]
==== Initialize nodes

Follow the steps to start Ethereum on **first** machine.

[[_code_node_init]]
[source,bash]
----
geth --data-dir eth-priv init eth-priv/genesis.json
----

[[_anchor_start_blockchain]]
==== Start blockchain
Start blockchain with the command below. Note that, the value of `--networkid` matches with the value of `chainId` in `genesis.json` file. Also, with the `--nodiscover` flag, this machine becomes a sort of host machine. Finally, this machine will listen of peering connections at port number `30333`.

[[_code_start_blockchain]]
[source,bash]
----
geth --datadir "/home/ubuntu/eth-priv" --networkid 15 --nodiscover --maxpeers 3  --port 30333 console
----

From the console, get the node value.

[[_code_add_node]]
[source,bash]
----
admin.nodeInfo.enode
"enode://342a11d352151b3dfeb78db02a4319e1255c9fb49bc9a1dc44485f7c1bca9cc638540833e4577016f9a6180d1e911d907280af9b3892c53120e1e30619594eba@[::]:30333?discport=0"
----

[[_anchor_peering]]
=== Peering

==== Peering with `bootnode`
When installing Ethereum (refer <<_anchor_install_ethereum_client>>), `bootnode`, and few other standalone tools, are also installed. With the genesis state (refer <<_anchor_node_configuration>>) defined for all machines, peer discovery via boot node is done with the following command.

https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Setting-up-private-network-or-local-cluster#setup-bootnode
https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/a/8955/3137

[source,bash]
----
bootnode --genkey=boot.key  // <1>
bootnode --nodekey=boot.key // <2>
----
<1> Generate a key to derive `enode` identifier for the boot node and save it to `boot.key` file.
<2> Start boot node with the node key as available in `boot.key` file.

Refer the `enode://` URI in `geth` commands subsequently as shown below.

[source,bash]
----
geth --bootnodes "enode://...@[::]:30301"
---- 

==== Peering manually

1. Log on to second machine, create folder `eth-priv` and copy `genesis.json` (created above) here. Start Ethereum with command below.

[source,bash]
----
geth --datadir "/home/ubuntu/eth-priv" --networkid 15 --maxpeers 3  --port 30333 console
----

2. From the console, add peer.

To add a peer, replace the `[::]` in the node information value (see step 3 in previous section) of the first machine with the public IP address of the first machine.

[[_code_add_peer]]
[source,bash]
----
admin.addPeer("enode://342a11d352151b3dfeb78db02a4319e1255c9fb49bc9a1dc44485f7c1bca9cc638540833e4577016f9a6180d1e911d907280af9b3892c53120e1e30619594eba@18.0.0.0:30333?discport=0")
----

Use `admin.peers` function to list connected peers.

Repeat the above steps on the third machine.

On the fourth machine, add a `static-nodes.json` file in the `eth-priv` folder with the node information of the first machine. For example,

[[_code_connected_node]]
[source,json]
----
[
    "enode:///342a11d352151b3dfeb78db02a4319e1255c9fb49bc9a1dc44485f7c1bca9cc638540833e4577016f9a6180d1e911d907280af9b3892c53120e1e30619594eba@18.0.0.0:30333"
]
----

[[_anchor_start_nodes]]
==== Start nodes

1. Log onto first machine and start Ethereum with the command below.

[[_code_start_node_nodiscover]]
[source,bash]
----
geth --datadir "/home/ubuntu/eth-priv" --networkid 15 --nodiscover --maxpeers 2  --port 30333 console
----

2. Log onto second machine and start Ethereum with the command below.

[[_code_start_node]]
[source,bash]
----
geth --datadir "/home/ubuntu/eth-priv" --networkid 15 --port 30333 console
----

3. Check for connected peer with the command below.

[[_code_node_list]]
[source,bash]
----
admin.peers
----

4. Exit with `Ctrl-D` on the third machine.

[[_anchor_account_setup]]
==== Set-up accounts

For now, we will set-up accounts only on the third machine. First, we launch the console as shown below.

[[_code_console_launch]]
[source,bash]
----
geth --datadir "/home/ubuntu/eth-priv" --networkid 15 console
----

Then, we add an account as below.

[[_code_add_account]]
[source,bash]
----
geth --datadir "/home/ubuntu/eth-priv" account new
----

Finally, we start the mining process so that ethers are credited to this account.

[[_code_start_mining]]
[source,bash]
----
geth --datadir "/home/ubuntu/eth-priv" --networkid 15 --mine
----

We can check the balance using the following command on the console.

[[_code_account_balance]]
[source,bash]
----
eth.getBalance(eth.accounts[0])
----

[[_anchor_RPC]]
==== Start RPC

On the third machine, open up the RPC port to allow for communication with a client.

[[_code_start_rpc]]
[source,bash]
----
geth --datadir eth-priv --networkid 15 --maxpeers 2 --port 30333 --rpc --rpcapi "web3,eth,personal" --rpcaddr "0.0.0.0" --rpccorsdomain "*"
----

**NOTE** that, the `--rpcaddr 0.0.0.0` value has been set for testing only. This value is **strongly discouraged**.

[[_anchor_mining]]
=== Mining

[[_code_start_mining_rpc]]
[source,bash]
----
geth --datadir eth-priv --networkid 15 --maxpeers 3 --port 30333 --rpc --rpcapi "web3,eth,personal" --rpcaddr "0.0.0.0" --rpccorsdomain "*" --mine
----
