<p>How to start writing.</p>

<p>The visual editor vs. the code editor</p>

<p>Supported file types</p>

<p>Atlas supports four different markup languages: HTML, markdown, asciidoc, and docbook. To use the Visual Editor, write your project in HTML making sure to adhere to the HTMLBook spec, or just use the Visual Editor right from the beginning (it already follows the HTMLBook rules).</p>

<p>What is a section?</p>

<p>An integral part of the HTMLBook spec is the concept of sections.&nbsp;</p>

<section data-type="sect1">
<h1>The Magic Line</h1>

<p>Hover over this paragraph of text. See that blue line that appears? That line helps you insert a new block wherever it shows up. By default, the line will insert just a plain paragraph, but once you do that, you can use the Insert... menu to change that new paragraph into a whole new section,&nbsp;sidebar, note, or some other book element.</p>

<section data-type="sect2">
<h2>Try It!</h2>

<p>Follow these steps to get started using the magic line:</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>Hover over the above paragraph and click the arrow at the right of the magic blue line.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Now go to the insert menu, and choose &quot;Section&quot;.</p>

	<p>Atlas inserts a new, nested section at the correct level. For example, if you are currently within a Section 1 block, Atlas will insert a Section 2.</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<div data-type="warning">
<h1>Warning</h1>

<p>Sometimes the magic line won't appear after the last section in a chapter. To get around this, insert a new paragraph at the very end of the file. The magic line should then appear.</p>
